# Map Manager

## Adding maps

To add a map called *name.map*, simply place the map inside the *maps/* folder of this resource (not this folder) and execute the following command:
    /addmap name

If the map is in an interior, you might want to execute
    /setmapdimension name interior

## Removing maps

    /removemap name
